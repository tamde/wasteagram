# wasteagram

Wasteagram is a mobile application built with the Flutter SDK and Dart.
This app allows users to take pictures of wasted food and record the amount
that was wasted. It also accesses the location API on the mobile device to 
record the longtitude and latitude of where the picture was taken.
Additionally, the data (pictures, location, etc.) is stored using Cloud Firestore.
